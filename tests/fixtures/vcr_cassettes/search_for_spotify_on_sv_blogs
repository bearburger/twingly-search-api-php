For example recently it has been updated to stream music from Spotify and order a pizza. However it looks like Amazon has made some changes where it will now be able to call you an Uber, as announced on Uber’s blog. According to Uber, “Now you don’t have to rely on your phone when you’re ready to go. You can simply ask Alexa to order an Uber for you, and she’ll request a ride right to your door.” Just like the rest of the commands you issue to Amazon’s Alexa, users will need to speak specific phrases for it to work. For example if you want an Uber, you’ll have to say, “Alexa, ask Uber to request a ride.”; or “Alexa, ask Uber to request an Uber X.”; or “Alexa, ask Uber where’s my ride?”. If this sounds good, all you’d have to do to enable the feature is to set your Echo’s location via the Settings menu in the Alexa app, enable “Uber” under the Skills section of the app, link it to your Uber account, and you’re good to go. Uber has also announced that if this is your first time using Uber, you can enter the 15Alexa code to get $15 off your first ride. In the meantime you can watch it in action in the video above, courtesy of The Verge.  Amazon Echo Can Now Order You An Uber , original content from Ubergizmo.

This time: New Hampshire. \r\nWe’ve already brought you tunes to keep a roving political reporter sane while logging miles in a rental car in Iowa. \r\nNow, it’s onto the Granite State and the first-in-the-nation primary contest, which happens Tuesday, February 9. \r\nFirst a reminder of how this works. The rules are pretty loose, but every time I arrive in a new state I build a short Spotify playlist for myself just to get my head into the right geographic frame of mind. It’s always short, just six or seven songs. Each has to have some connection to the state I’m in. Either the artist was born or lived there, or maybe the song itself mentions the state, a city, or some iconic landmark. Any connection at all works. No reed too thin. And the list isn’t meant to be definitive — just a mix of genres, styles, eras, and artists to make for a fun listen. \r\nSo, here’s my list for for the New Hampshire primary. \r\n \r\n1. “Grovers Corners” // Aaron Copland \r\nWe set the scene with a beautiful piece of American classical music from one of our greatest composers. \r\nHere Copland writes about the mythical New Hampshire town of Grover’s Corners, where playwright Thorton Wilder’s timeless drama Our Town is set. \r\n2. “Live Free or Die” // Bill Morrissey\r\nThe late Bill Morrissey is one of New England’s most talented singer/songwriters of the past few decades. His albums are full of songs about life in New Hampshire. Some are poignant and sad, some wickedly funny … like this tale of an inmate doing time in a New Hampshire state prison, stamping out license plates with the state’s motto: Live Free or Die. \r\n3. “The Old Man of the Mountain” // Cab Calloway (performed here by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy) \r\nCab Calloway and his big band, known for such hits as “Minnie the Moocher,” wrote this song in 1933. The Old Man in the Mountain is New Hampshire’s most famous natural landmark, a rock formation atop a mountain in Franconia that looks just like the profile of an old man. It isn’t quite what it once was, since a large chunk of it fell off in 2003 (Hey, it happens to all of us). \r\nThis song swings. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy included this on the 2009 CD “How Big Can You Get?: The Music of Cab Calloway.” Listen to the whole thing. And to the Cab Calloway 1933 original.  \r\n4. “Merrimack River” // Mandy Moore \r\nSome pure pop music from this New Hampshire native who’s carved out a career in music and movies. The Merrimack River flows south through Concord, Manchester and Nashua. \r\n5. “Okay Alright” // moe.\r\nThis one came to me from some crowdsourcing on Twitter. Moe. is an alt-rock outfit big on the Bonnaroo festival circuit. This one is plenty catchy. That’s why it’s here — in addition to the line in the first verse: “Goodbye Suzie, goodbye UNH” (the University of New Hampshire). \r\n6. “Supernova” // Ray LaMontagne \r\nAnother New Hampshire native who’s made it big on the alternative rock/country/folk circuit. LaMontagne was born in 1973 in Nashua. I kind of love the opening line of Rolling Stone‘s review of LaMontagne’s Supernova CD: “With his impeccably weathered tenor croon and mastery of Seventies singer-songwriterisms, Ray LaMontagne can often seem in danger of disappearing into his beard.” It is a serious beard. The music is pretty retro too. \r\n7. “High Hopes” // Frank Sinatra\r\nSo what has Sinatra got to do with New Hampshire? This song takes two paths to earn its spot on the playlist. Remember the old prime-time soap opera Peyton Place from the Sixties? It was set in a fictional New Hampshire town. It starred a young Mia Farrow, who would become Mrs. Frank Sinatra. So he makes the list. \r\nPlus, John Kennedy won the 1960 New Hampshire primary. His campaign theme song that year was Sinatra singing a version of “High Hopes,” with lyrics telling voters to “back Jack.” \r\nEveryone wants to back — Jack   Jack is on the right track.   ‘Cause he’s got high hopes   He’s got high hopes   Nineteen Sixty’s the year for his high hopes. \r\n\r\n\r\nSource Article from http://www.npr.org/2016/02/05/465637500/listen-correspondent-don-gonyeas-new-hampshire-playlist?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=politics]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-06 02:03:07Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-06 02:33:07Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://www.irasciblemusings.com/</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[Irascible Musings]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>5</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>1</blogRank>\r\n  <tags>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[NPR]]></tag>\r\n  </tags>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>http://www.iphonefirmware.com/just-how-to-uncover-the-concealed-uber-vip-system</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[Just How To Uncover The Concealed Uber VIP System]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Uber may’ whether that s the best thing or not is determined by your position on whether there&rsquo, and t remain from the information at this time;s this type of positive thing as negative advertising. The net doesn’t be seemingly all that pleased with the look of the new emblem\_and the\_fairly complicated idea behind the brand new marketing. Taxi people don’t like them. Their very own individuals don& rsquo. But hello – an Uber is approximately as handy because it gets if you want an automobile. \r\nTherefore if you& rsquo -im and occur to reside in Nyc, Colorado or Wa, amongst different places, you could find rsquo & that you;re an VIP. Ve likely had a contact to inform you if you’re, you&rsquo. Congratulations! \r\n \r\nNot at all publicised by Uber, possibly because of it being area-particular, Uber VIP provides the opportunity to get a level greater driving experience to those individuals who have requested 100 or even more vehicles. To be able to do this, customers motorists are just shown by Uber having a score of even more or 4.8 and who generate high end vehicles. It s basically a means of weeding out poor people motorists with regular vehicles, which might clarify the place-uniqueness here. \r\n \r\nTrips in Uber VIP vehicles charge just like a UberBLACK vehicle, but because of the smaller share of vehicles that are offered for you, it’s probable you’ll need to delay only a little longer for the trip if you opt for that VIP treatment. You are able to, obviously, downgrade and order only human’s vehicle via the app on a buy-by-order foundation, but where’s the enjoyment in that?\_Nowhere, that’s where. \r\n \r\nSo far as benefits proceed, this really is among our favorites and rsquo & it;s only a disgrace that of actually Uber’s many faithful customers a fairly little part will have the ability to make the most of it. Perhaps, to some bigger quantity of places, it’ll roll-out over time. Wouldn’t that be nice? \r\n(Via: Company Expert) \r\nYou may even like to check out: \r\n\r\nUber To Quickly Provide Inexpensive Chopper Support In Collaboration With Airbus\r\nNow You Can Purchase An Uber, Flow Spotify Utilizing Amazon Match\r\nFacebook Messenger Receives Uber Incorporation, 3D Touch Assistance, More\r\nHow To Locate Your Uber Traveler Score]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-06 01:33:25Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-06 02:08:36Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://www.iphonefirmware.com/</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[iPhoneFirmware.com: all the latest from Apple and the Web!]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>14</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>2</blogRank>\r\n  <tags>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[News]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[android]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[iOS]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[iPhone]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[Uber]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[Web]]></tag>\r\n  </tags>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>http://www.thaigaming.com/software/1242251.htm</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[[MULTI] Abelssoft Recordify Plus v1.3]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Abelssoft Recordify Plus v1.3 | 17.3 MB \r\n \r\n \r\nRecordify 2016 \r\n \r\nDownload Spotify Music For Free \r\nMusic from the streaming services like Spotify is very popular, but unfortunately the free Spotify version doesn't let you save the music offline.

It ascends into skies eternally Springlike, because that’s where youth lives, always renewing, forever golden. Victoria Canal is a singer and songwriter who lives now in Atlanta, and she’s just released her debut EP Into The Pull, five songs long, designed to make your heart swell – with possibility, with hopeful melodies and with the energy of creation above all. Thankfully she took a break from reading Jane Eyre to speak with us about the making of her EP, her international upbringing and her dreams for the future. She was absolutely charming and eloquent. She’s bound for something special. So read on, and catch the first glimpse of a future supernova as it crackles and sparks… What is your first musical memory, and do you think it relates in any way to the songs you write now? My first musical memory is probably watching home videos of me when I was three or four years old, sitting with my grandmother who was a piano teacher. What remember musically first was listening to “Man in the Mirror” by Michael Jackson and playing it out by ear on the piano. I must have been like seven or eight years old when I was starting to learn to play the piano, that was really when I discovered what music was to me consciously, and I realized that writing was a really fascinating thing and it all seemed to be unattainable – like a whole other universe – and I think that was when I started getting closer and closer to what it was to be a musician. It sounds like you realized pretty early on that you had an aptitude for music. It was more like my parents realized for me that I had an aptitude! They always saw that I had innate rhythm and a sense of melody, and when we listened to music in the car I would bounce up and down and enjoy myself always when music was on. The earliest I could talk was when I started to sing, and that was really when my grandma introduced me to instruments and piano. I started taking classical lessons at six years old, and from then on music has just been a really instrumental (no pun intended) part of my growth as a person.  So are your parents musical people? Well, my mom is very artistically inclined and she actually studied architecture and is an incredible visual artist. My dad is not an artist at all – he studied chemical engineering and is in business management now. But it really came from my American grandmother and my brother especially. Growing up I would listen to a lot of what he listened to. My parents as well listened to a lot of classic rock, from what I remember, as well as opera. Then growing up when I was in lower school I would listen to NSYNC and Backstreet Boys because that’s what all my brothers were listening to. So yeah, my background in music has been really varied – it’s just been whatever is melodically enticing and engaging. So I’m understanding that you started really early with formal training – you said it was classical training when you were six. Was that on the piano with your grandma?  It wasn’t with my grandma – we’re too stubborn to work together. When I lived in Spain I started taking lessons from my piano teacher there as well as classical voice. It wasn’t really until I was eleven that I really started legitimately writing songs and delving into contemporary music on my own. How did you decide what five songs would be on the EP?  It actually came together really smoothly. I think it was almost up to the producer I was working with,\_Jan Smith.\_In her studio I just started playing this song for her – it’s actually the last song on the EP. It’s called “Little Girl” and we went in and recorded that first, and it kind of just went from there. I started playing her all my songs and one by one we picked the ones that were my favorites and her favorites and it came together and resulted in a nice, solid five songs. (Photo by Zack Arias) The production of these songs sounds so layered and full and lush. Did you have most of the musical ideas in your head before you recorded them, or did they grow over time?  I definitely cannot take credit for how incredible the production is on them. That was really up to the producers in the studio. I wish I had that skill and it’s something I’m definitely planning on focusing on in the next couple of years, to really hone in on the production side. When I wrote the songs, I basically imagined more rhythm than just playing them on the keys or the ukulele or guitar, and went into the studio with a really open mind because I really wanted it to be a collaboration between me and the producers. I like strings, so I knew I wanted to include those on at least a couple of tracks, and I also wanted piano to be a part of the sound. Other than that, I really left it up to our time in the studio together to come up with what we liked most and what best fit the emotion and the message of the songs. How much editing do you do – getting rid of ideas or changing them – before you feel like a song is finished? Usually it takes me a pretty long time. When I write I usually get most if not all of the song down and done, and then I leave it for a little bit to kind of marinate and think about it a little bit. After I’ve given it a bit of time, I go back and I make changes lyrically or melodically. One of the things I’ve found is that after playing it live a lot, without me even really being able to tell, it’ll transform. If I record my first performance of a song, like “Unclear” let’s say, the way I perform it now –there’s a huge difference stylistically, and there are things that change little by little. So I definitely think when it comes to recording the songs I want to have performed those songs for quite a while to know what I like – to bring out more in the song.  It’s like a living thing that’s growing. Exactly. I have to let it cultivate itself and grow a little bit, and I have to get comfortable with it. It’s kind of like a relationship – before I legitimize it by recording it, I need it to settle for a bit. The video for “Unclear” is very, very beautiful. How did you develop the visuals so that they reflected the song so well?  Well, getting into it I knew I wanted it to have a nostalgic element, and I didn’t know how to elaborate on that. So when it came to making it, we had an entirely different idea and concept for the video up until the day before. The day before the creative co-director called me and said, “Hey I don’t think we’re going in the right direction. I think we need to do something that is attainable and still relatable and that people will find more visually realistic. So we talked it over and I talked about the emotions that the song gave me, and the fact that I wrote it while on my bed in my bedroom, just doodling on the ukulele – trying to forget all my worries and just trying to stop growing up.\_ At this point in my life, I’m trying to figure out what my purpose is and where I’m supposed to go from here. I’m finishing high school and figuring out whether I should go to college immediately and what I should do and what life is going to bring me and can I really predict that kind of stuff? You really kind of have to go with your gut and do what you love, and that was really the inspiration for the song – the existential question, the big questions.\_ If you could collaborate with one other songwriter, who would it be? Like, biggest dream ever? Why not? We love big dreams. Okay cool – I’ll just say it. I think opening for John Mayer on tour would be my biggest dream.  What is it about him?  John Mayer is really why I’m in music. My brother was one of my main musical “sources” because he listened to everything but he really was an avid John Mayer fan. I became one because of that, and as I grew up musically, I started appreciating him more on more than just a superficial level. I discovered him before I thought anything about boys, and I’m not obsessed with John Mayer because he’s cute. I’m obsessed with him because he is an incredible musician and songwriter and an artist with a lot of integrity. I’ve always just listened to him and observed his songwriting, and I’ve been told that my songwriting is clearly influenced by him. He’s just one of my main idols, and I think interacting with him in any way musically would be a dream come true. He’s a legend to me. What advice would you give to songwriters who are just starting out about how to develop their artistic voice?  I’ll give them some advice I’m trying to give myself right now. One is that I’ve always been in so much of a rush, and I think I have to be in less of a rush and really enjoy what I’m doing. So I would say to any young, especially female singers: don’t feel like you have to be a big deal when you’re 17. You have time to get there and just do what you love – if it’s being on the road, interacting with passionate musicians, or being behind the scenes or writing for other artists. Whatever you like to do, there’s plenty of time and you don’t have to be 17, 18, 19 and already have had a big successful career. I think there’s plenty of time and that’s what I need to remind myself of more. \_ The other piece of advice I would give is that a lot of people are obsessed with huge moments that impress people, or somehow validate what they are doing. I think that the little moments matter just as much, and whatever you want to get good at, whatever you are passionate about, you have to take it step by step and that’s really what’s going to make it worthwhile. Know that each step that you seek you’re taking actively in the direction that you want to end up in – as a human being and as an artist. It sounds like you’ve done a lot of traveling. What has that done for you as a\_developing\_artist and songwriter? I was born in Munich, Germany and then I was in several parts of Asia and the Middle East and Europe, and never actually in the United States until this past year to pursue music full time. I think it has helped me gain perspective in a way that a lot of people my age don’t get to do. I think I look at things – maybe this might be a curse more than a blessing – but I look at things in a much more nostalgic way. I miss people a lot more because I say goodbye a lot more. I’ve heard from other people that travel makes them less attached because they’re saying goodbye so much, but it has the opposite effect on me. I think that’s definitely affected my songwriting. I’m a very emotional person. I feel all the emotions very, very strongly, and appreciate people so much. That comes from having traveled and seeing how many different kinds of people there are are all over the world, and how much each of them adds to their surroundings and to their community. I think people are really beautiful and I’ve been able to learn that through seeing all different kinds.  Do you have a favorite place you’ve been so far? Barcelona is a favorite for me and also London – anywhere that my family is. My Cuban grandparents live in Barceleona, and whenever I’m there I feel like I’m home. I don’t know London very well, but my brothers live there so I feel like I’m home when I’m there. My parents just moved to Amsterdam, so when I’m there I feel at home. So it’s really anyplace that my family is that I feel most at home and feel like that’s my favorite place. What are some of your favorite things to do when you’re not working on music?\_  Family is a big deal because I don’t get to see them often. I love TV – Friends is a classic, and I like New Girl, Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder. Jane the Virgin is my most recent favorite. I love sleeping and I love food, but just recently I’ve gone vegan so that’s going to be a challenge and a big adventure. I love books – and ping pong! I’m not a very sporty person, but when it comes to ping pong, I will beat you. (laughing) There’s a guarantee. I grew up playing it in Shanghai and Tokyo and it was a big part of my day.  …and finally, what are some of your favorite songs? Surely there’s some John Mayer in there…   Yeah, (laughing). “Stop This Train” and “Slow Dancing in a Burning Room” are two of my favorites by him. “Cavalier” by James Vincent McMorrow. I love “Re: Stacks” by Bon Iver, and I just recently discovered Kevin Garret. “Refuse” has a beautiful, beautiful piano and he plays really well live. I think when it comes to music, I obsess over artists and their entire work rather than songs in particular. That’s the way that I love exploring music –through the artist and their entire catalog.  It’s like reading whole book instead of just one chapter  Exactly. What I discovered with the new Coldplay album or the Adele album or even Justin Beiber is that I like buying them and then taking them on a walk through a park and listening to the entire thing, maybe twice or three times, to see why they put it in that order. Or I can imagine in my situation what the inspiration was for that song. I think I’m pretty analytical about it, but also very emotional, which makes me feel like it’s a good way for a person to feel connected to something – whether it be that artist or the person they’re imagining, that artist is telling them they are not alone or that they understand. Just today Ms. Canal released her\_“City Shoes” single, and you can do yourself an immense favor by downloading it and her Into The Pull EP from iTunes or streaming it on Spotify.]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-06 01:13:30Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-06 01:58:54Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://theautumnroses.tumblr.com/</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[The Autumn Roses]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>3</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>1</blogRank>\r\n  <tags>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[music]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[victoria canal]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[atlanta]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[into the pull]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[unclear]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[city shoes]]></tag>\r\n  </tags>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>http://android-now.blogspot.com/2016/02/google-android-news-android-forums_5.html</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[Google Android News Android Forums]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Google Android News Android Forums                  Firefox OS for smartphones is officially dead      BlackBerry laying off 200 employees between Canada and the US      Verizon’s Go90 no longer counts against data caps      [TA Deals] Get an understanding for Arduino with this guide (92% off)      This is apparently the front of the HTC One M10      Potential Project Ara modular smartphone benchmarked      Need an Uber?

Firefox OS was looking like it might be an interesting OS to run, but unfortunately,\_Firefox has issued a statement saying that they will be killing off\_Firefox OS on smartphones\_for good. They plan on using all their resources to focus on IoT instead.   Through the work of hundreds of contributors we made an awesome push and created an impressive platform in Firefox OS. However, as we announced in December, the circumstances of multiple established operating systems and app ecosystems meant that we were playing catch-up, and the conditions were not there for Mozilla to win on commercial smartphones. We have decided that in order to succeed in the new area of Connected Devices we must focus our energy completely on prototyping the future and exploring how we can make the biggest impact in IoT.   Firefox OS was used mostly in developing countries, but didn’t catch on too well. Mozilla plans on ending all support after version 2.6.

BlackBerry laying off 200 employees between Canada and the US       Posted: 05 Feb 2016 03:59 PM PST      We all thought BlackBerry could make a comeback with the Priv, but things still aren’t looking good for them. BlackBerry has now laid off hundreds of employees from Canada and Florida.   Those affected are specifically from their home\_Waterloo\_offices and\_Sunrise, FL location. The total will be around 200 employees combined.   \"As BlackBerry continues to execute its turnaround plan, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across our global work force. As a result, approximately 200 employees have been impacted in Canada and Florida. For those employees that have recently left the company, we know that they have worked hard on behalf of our company and we are grateful for their commitment and contributions.\"   BlackBerry has also recently shut down their “Built for BlackBerry”\_certification program for BlackBerry 10 apps last month. These recent cuts could\_mean BlackBerry is heavily moving away from native app development and focusing more on Android, which explains the need for less in-house\_employees. However, it could also mean they are badly hurting for cash. I am hoping it is not the later.

Verizon’s Go90 no longer counts against data caps       Posted: 05 Feb 2016 03:14 PM PST      Verizon rolled out an update to Go90 mobile content streaming app on Jan. 29. If you’re like most folks, you didn’t read much about the update. But one thing stands out.   Near the top of the description of what’s new about the app is this little nugget:   “Search for content you love and find exclusives only available on Go90. Verizon Wireless customers stream any video over LTE without it counting against your data plan.”      That’s right. You can use Go90 to stream shows over Verizon’s LTE network without it counting against your data total. And since Verizon no longer offers unlimited data, this is fantastic, right?   Well … maybe.   On its face, it seems great. What could be bad about being able to stream all your favorite content without using up all your data?   But Lifehacker calls it a “trap.”\_The problem, Lifehacker says, is that Verizon is using its status as a carrier to give itself an unfair leg up on the competition by allowing one of its own products to use Verizon’s network without counting against\_data limits, while other services do count against data limits. After all, why would you use a service that uses up your data when you could use one that doesn’t and save your data for other things?   Lifehacker is quick to point out that this is not a harbinger of any sort of Internet apocalypse. Rather, it’s a way in which Verizon is using capped data plans to “pick winners and losers on the Internet.”   Play Store download link      Come comment on this article: Verizon’s Go90 no longer counts against data caps     Visit TalkAndroid for Android news, Android guides, and much more!

This is apparently the front of the HTC One M10       Posted: 05 Feb 2016 01:18 PM PST      Later this month, Samsung and LG will be hosting events in Barcelona during MWC 2016 while HTC skips the conference to launch the One M10 at a later date. The reason for this is that HTC needs to be in the spotlight all on its own and avoid being overshadowed by two of its biggest competitors. So, until we finally see the company announce the handset, we’ll have rely upon leaks and reports to get an idea of what the One M10 will offer. Evan Blass, who exposes devices rapidly and accurately, revealed yesterday that the handset won’t have the annoying logo-stamped black bar below the display like the One (M7), One (M8), and One M9 did. But now we know what the front of the next One installment should look like.   Blass returned today to share an image of the HTC One M10 roaming around in the wild.         The image (seen above) shows the front of the One M10, which, yes, does heavily resemble Apple’s iPhone. We see that the black bar is indeed gone and a fingerprint scanner is integrated below the display. And that would align with a previous report that the handset will have a home button similar to the ones found on Samsung’s devices. It seems HTC is going to ditch on-screen buttons and stick with a somewhat physical home button, solving one of my biggest complaints regarding the HTC One A9.   Display size seems reasonable, likely assuring everyone that it won’t be above 5.5 inches. Sources say the display will measure 5.1 inches and have Quad HD (2560×1440) resolution.   Other specifications for the One M10 are said to include Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM, an Adreno 530 GPU, and 32GB of internal storage.   Again, don’t expect the One M10 at MWC 2015 in a few weeks because HTC wants to go solo with an event that should be scheduled for March or April.

Potential Project Ara modular smartphone benchmarked       Posted: 05 Feb 2016 01:10 PM PST      A post on GFXBench could show some of the features of Google’s Project Ara modular smartphone, said to feature two separate\_storage modules.      The apparent specs sheet appearing on the benchmarking website\_may simply be detailing a prototype build of the modular smartphone, but it makes for an interesting read nonetheless.   According to the document,\_Google’s Project Ara device runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and features a 1920 x 1080 touchscreen display. Although the benchmark lists the screen at 13.8-inches, this might\_be a mistake. 13.8cm converted to inches is around 5.4-inches, which is obviously\_more realistic for a smartphone screen.   Another theory is that the benchmark is detailing a Project Ara tablet, although there’s been no word from Google that such a device\_is in the works.      Interestingly,\_the benchmark lists two different\_storage figures at 10GB and 25GB, which could mean that the smartphone was equipped with two separate storage modules during testing.   The device is running on a\_Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor and Adreno 430 GPU, offering 2.7Gb of memory.   In terms of camera power, the document mentions a 0.3-megapixel back camera with autofocus technology, face detection software and flash. It doesn’t support HDR image capture, however.\_The front camera is\_listed at\_4.8-megapixels.   Other features mentioned\_for the potential Google gadget include an accelerometer, Bluetooth, NFC, a pedometer, a barometer and a compass.   Whether or not we’re looking at the actual specs of Google’s Project Ara smartphone remains to be seen, but the document spotted on GFXBench certainly has us excited. It looks like we’re edging closer to the day where we can build our smartphones at home with all the ingredients we choose.

Need an Uber? Ask Alexa       Posted: 05 Feb 2016 11:26 AM PST      Need to order a ride from Uber but don’t want to bother taking your phone out of your pocket? You’re in luck.      Uber has integrated its API with Alexa, the brain behind Amazon Echo. Just say “Alexa, order me an Uber” or “Alexa, ask Uber to get me a car” and soon, one will show up at your door. Other variants of that phrase will work too, Uber said, but those are a good place to start. You can also ask “Alexa, how far away is my Uber” and your Echo\_will tell you when to expect your ride.   To sync Uber and Echo, set your Echo’s location in the settings of your Echo app. Then, in the skills section of the app, enable the Uber skill and link your account. Bonus: If you’re new to Uber, use the code 15Alexa to get $15 off your ride.   Uber is hardly the first service to integrate with Echo. Spotify recently came to Echo\_and Ford announced at CES 2016\_that it was going to integrate Echo into some of its vehicles. Alarm.com has also announced that it would be using Echo for its smart home control.   Source: Uber      Come comment on this article: Need an Uber?
